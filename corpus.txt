An important discovery has been made during the excavations in the Haydarpaşa Train Station in Istanbul’s Kadıköy neighborhood. A burial monument from the late Hellenistic period, which is a first for Istanbul, has been unearthed.Archaeologist Rahmi Asal, director of the Istanbul Archaeological Museums, said, “It is an incredible find, a great surprise for Istanbul. Unfortunately, we do not have much data from the Hellenistic period. Especially in architecture and tombs, we know very little. Therefore, we are faced with a particularly important find. Istanbul’s history is being rewritten.”

Archaeological excavations, which started in 2018 on an area of approximately 300,000 square meters at the Haydarpaşa Train Station, are about to come to an end. The latest discovery was made as 90 percent of works have been completed.

The find was a first in the excavation area, where many historical structures and items, dating back to a term between the Antiquity and Republican Period, have been unearthed since the day the works started.

A burial monument from the Late Hellenistic Period, has been found in the area, which is named the north-west port of the city of Chalcedon in ancient sources.“From the beginning of the work, both architectural remains and other archaeological finds have been unearthed. We already knew that we were carrying out excavation work at a very important spot. In the sources, this region is mentioned as the north-west port of Chalcedon,” Asal said, speaking about the excavations.

Stating that when they started the excavations, there was an architectural ruin that they saw between the platforms, Asal continued:

“We defined this architectural relic as a Hellenistic remnant because of the small finds around it and its architectural features fit that time. We were not sure about its exact period. We thought that it might be a burial monument, as a similar example was found in 1987 in Kadıköy’s Altıyol area.”

“Later, as the excavations progressed, the architectural structure was revealed once the platforms had also removed. We unearthed a new find about five days ago. A tomb dating to the Late Hellenistic Period was uncovered. Since the tomb also contains finds, it provides very clear periodical data. We were able to clarify the date of the tomb thanks to the terracotta bottles, placed in it as burial gifts.”

“This is a tomb from the Late Hellenistic Period and an incredible find for Istanbul, a huge surprise. Unfortunately, we do not have much data from the Hellenistic Period. Especially since there are very few architectural remains and tombs. Therefore, this is an especially important find.” “The history of Istanbul is being rewritten, as metro and Marmaray excavations continue. The Istanbul Archaeological Museums have been changing the history of the city for 20 years.” Stating that they had mostly completed the excavation, Asal said, “Work in the area still continues under a new project. If different spots are not to be excavated, we have completed 90 percent of the excavation, or even more in this project. We continue the excavations in two-to-three main spots. This is one of them. An archaeology park and one or two museums can be built in this area when the works are finished.” Authorities have announced hikes in electricity and natural gas prices for households as well as industrial users. The Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) said in a statement that electricity prices for households and industry were increased by 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively.

The new tariffs took effect as of June 1.

Separately, the state-owned Petroleum Pipeline Corporation (BOTAŞ) announced that it increased natural gas prices for households by 30 percent.

The price of natural gas used in electricity production was hiked by 16.3 percent and by 10.2 percent for gas used in industry.

Turkey imports 99 percent of the natural gas it consumes under international agreements, BOTAŞ said in the statement, recalling that energy prices have been on the rise since 2021 globally, describing the situation in the European and world markets as a “perfect storm.”

“The high energy prices that emerged in global markets have been fully passed on to local consumers. However, it became inevitable to increase the natural gas prices as of June 1,” BOTAŞ said, adding that the latest hikes in gas prices were designed in a way to minimize the impact on consumers. According to the İTO data, wholesale prices in Istanbul, which increased by 5.33 percent month-on-month in April, advanced 5.76 percent last month.

The annual increase in wholesale prices quickened from 73.21 percent to 79.12 percent.

The Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) will release the nationwide inflation data for May on June 3.

Consumer prices in the country increased by 7.25 percent in April, while the annual inflation rate accelerated from 61.1 percent in March to 69.97 percent in April.On an annual basis, retail prices exhibited an increase of 87.35 percent.

The rate of increase in retail prices on a monthly basis in the country’s largest city, however, eased. In April, retail prices in Istanbul soared 11.36 percent from March.

Food prices rose by 4.97 percent for an annual increase of 84.4 percent last month, with bread and grain prices increasing 5 percent month-on-month and 90.1 percent year-on-year.

The increase in housing expenses was 7.22 percent, bringing the annual rise to 97 percent, İTO said.

The cost of eating out rose by 18.5 percent in May from April for an increase of 77 percent year-on-year.

Clothing prices were up 6.9 percent month-on-month and 48.9 percent from a year ago.

Transport costs in the city were 3.8 percent higher in May than they were in April.The Biden administration says it will send Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been begging for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region.


The rocket systems are part of a new $700 million tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, two senior administration officials said Tuesday. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the weapons package that will be formally unveiled on Wednesday.

The U.S. decision to provide the advanced rocket systems tries to strike a balance between the desire to help Ukraine battle ferocious Russian artillery barrages while not providing arms that could allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia and trigger an escalation in the war.

In a guest essay published Tuesday evening in The New York Times, President Joe Biden confirmed that he’s decided to “provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.”

Biden had said Monday that the U.S. would not send Ukraine “rocket systems that can strike into Russia.” Any weapons system can shoot into Russia if it’s close enough to the border. The aid package expected to be unveiled Wednesday would send what the U.S. considers medium-range rockets, they generally can travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers), the officials said.

The Ukrainians have assured U.S. officials that they will not fire rockets into Russian territory, according to the senior administration officials. One official noted that the advanced rocket systems will give Ukrainian forces greater precision in targeting Russian assets inside Ukraine.

The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could both intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk.

Sievierodonetsk is important to Russian efforts to capture the Donbas before more Western arms arrive to bolster Ukraine’s defense. The city, which is 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of the Russian border, is in an area that is the last pocket under Ukrainian government control in the Luhansk region of the Donbas.

Biden in his New York Times’ essay added: “We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.”

It’s the 11th package approved so far, and will be the first to tap the $40 billion in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from U.S. inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two.

Officials said the plan is to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles (300 kilometers) and is not part of the plan.


Since the war began in February, the U.S. and its allies have tried to walk a narrow line: send Ukraine weapons needed to fight off Russia, but stop short of providing aid that will inflame Russian President Vladimir Putin and trigger a broader conflict that could spill over into other parts of Europe.

Over time, however, the U.S. and allies have amped up the weaponry going into Ukraine, as the fight has shifted from Russia’s broader campaign to take the capital, Kyiv, and other areas, to more close-contact skirmishes for small pieces of land in the east and south.

To that end, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading with the West to send multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine as soon as possible to help stop Russia’s destruction of towns in the Donbas. The rockets have a longer range than the howitzer artillery systems that the U.S. has provided Ukraine. They would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a distance outside the range of Russia’s artillery systems.

“We are fighting for Ukraine to be provided with all the weapons needed to change the nature of the fighting and start moving faster and more confidently toward the expulsion of the occupiers,” Zelenskyy said in a recent address.

Ukraine needs multiple launch rocket systems, said Philip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who was NATO’s top commander from 2013 to 2016.

“These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,” said Breedlove. “We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield.”

U.S. and White House officials had no public comment on the specifics of the aid package.

“We continue to consider a range of systems that have the potential to be effective on the battlefield for our Ukrainian partners. But the point the president made is that we won’t be sending long-range rockets for use beyond the battlefield in Ukraine,” State Department Ned Price said Tuesday. “As the battle has shifted its dynamics, we have also shifted the type of security assistance that we are providing to them, in large part because they have asked us for the various systems that are going to be more effective in places like the Donbas.”

Russia has been making incremental progress in the Donbas, as it tries to take the remaining sections of the region not already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Putin has repeatedly warned the West against sending greater firepower to Ukraine. The Kremlin said Putin held an 80-minute telephone call Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of Western weapons.

Overall, the United States has committed approximately $5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, including approximately $4.5 billion since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.Authorities are working on a new regulation that would introduce a cap on rent increases, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ has said.


“The limit in rent hikes will be based on the inflation rate, and this will be a temporary measure,” Bozdağ told reporters in the Central Anatolian province of Yozgat.

Officials from the Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Trade Ministry and the Treasury and Finance Ministry will soon conclude their study on the regulation regarding rent hikes, the minister said, adding that officials are looking at the practises in other countries.

When the cap is set, consumer price inflation will be taken into account, but it will be the rate which will be acceptable by both sides (landlords and tenants), said Bozdağ.

In earlier remarks, Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Minister Murat Kurum said that regulations designed to prevent exorbitant increases in rent prices will be submitted to parliament soon, adding that the government is also working to increase the supply of residential units.

The minister said that the legislation on rent could be sent to the national assembly within eight to 10 days.

Kurum reiterated that rent hikes cannot exceed the consumer price inflation. “However, some people increase rents for their properties well above the inflation rate, which is in fact the violation of laws. Tenants, who face such rent increases, should go to courts,” he said.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will make the plans under consideration on rent public soon, then the bill be submitted to parliament, the minister added.

Not only the Environment Ministry, but other ministries were also be involved in the work on rent regulations which will protect both tenants and landlords, Kurum said.

More house supply

Erdoğan will also announce the details of plans to boost house supply in August, according to the minister.

Kurum recalled the recently unveiled scheme under which public lands will be sold to people for them to build houses, especially in large cities such as Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir.

He dismissed claims that the main beneficiary of this scheme will not be ordinary citizens but certain circles.

“Those lands will only be allocated to low-income people, to those who do not own a house,” Kurum said.


Elaborating on plans for the Housing Development Administration (TOKİ) to build more houses, the minister said that TOKİ will develop projects in all 81 provinces in Turkey but that it will focus particularly on the provinces where there are house shortages.

TOKİ will be able to offer the houses it builds to potential buyers at more affordable prices as land costs will not affect TOKİ’s projects in terms of sale prices, according to the minister.

TOKİ projects will also target those, who are not homeowners and low-income groups, Kurum said.In wheelchairs and on stretchers, in ambulances and on train station platforms, they wait. Medical workers pull out ramps and wheel the patients onto the specially equipped train that will carry them westwards, away from the fighting raging in eastern Ukraine.


Run by the aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), the train is a lifeline for the overwhelmed hospitals in cities and towns near Ukraine’s front lines that are struggling to cope with an influx of war wounded on top of their usual flow of sick patients.

“Since the beginning of the war, the hospital capacity in the east is under pressure,” said Yasser Kamaledin, MSF’s emergency project coordinator for the medical evacuation train, which includes an intensive care unit.

“The idea of this activity is to support the hospitals that are closer to the front line, to empty some bed capacity so they can receive more patients from the attacks, the conflict, but also other chronic patients,” Kamaledin said.

Since it started running on March 31, the train has ferried nearly 600 people to hospitals in safer areas of western Ukraine, he said, including around 30 more people on Sunday.

They included 40-year-old Mykola Pastukh. He was wounded Saturday near Sievierodonetsk by a mortar shell that landed as he tried to ferry humanitarian aid into the city, which has been under fierce attack as Russian forces intensify their efforts to seize Ukrainian territory in the east.

There was still shrapnel inside him, he said as he stood on the train platform nursing his right arm in a sling under his shirt.

He needed surgery but the hospital in Lysychansk, a city close to Sievierodonetsk that was also under fierce Russian attack, just couldn’t cope. So he was being evacuated to Lviv in western Ukraine for the operation.

There are other, regular evacuation trains going west and onto which older people and the sick are boarded, but the MSF train is especially equipped to care for patients.

The pressure on Ukraine’s eastern hospitals is most evident after an attack, when casualties arrive one after the other.

Last week, medics wheeled a patient with severe head injuries into the hospital in the town of Pokrovsk as doctors, jaws clenched, triaged patients who were wounded when two rockets landed.

There were only a handful of wounded people. But the hospital is stretched. It has been operating with around half the staff it used to have, working with a backdrop of sandbags stacked up against boarded-up windows.


Before the war “when there was normal work, we had 10 surgeons, now we have five,” said Dr. Ivan Mozhaiev. In his department, the 32-year-old is the only surgeon who remained out of five.

The radical change in the nature of their work since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 has added an extra strain on the doctors and nurses who remain in hospitals near the fighting.

“Earlier we treated people from illnesses, sometimes there were traumas. Now we have to treat people from gunshot wounds,” said Dr. Viktor Krikliy, head of surgery at a hospital in the eastern city of Kramatorsk.


The city itself has come under attack, including on April 8, when a missile struck Kramatorsk train station, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 100.

Many medical staff have left, and the hospital has had to shut down several departments while still providing care for people from the city and nearby towns. Krikliy’s section of the hospital has two surgery departments, which each used to have 15 surgeons. Now there are only six left for both. It’s the same with nurses, with units operating on around half the staff levels they had before the war.

Kramatorsk hospital, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, has had to deal with war injuries before. The region, along with neighboring Luhansk, is part of the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014 and have controlled sections of eastern Ukraine since then.

Krikliy had to operate on the wounded then too, “but the scale now and then is incomparable,” he said. In 2014, it was soldiers, but this is the first time that the medical staff in Kramatorsk are seeing many wounded civilians.

“We could not even dream in the most terrible nightmare” that civilians in Ukraine would suffer such injuries, he said, describing having to operate on young children whose limbs were blown off by explosions.

Despite the danger, and the physical and emotional toll of working under such conditions, Krikliy has no intentions of leaving.

“We are surgeons. Our task is to operate on the people and treat them. If everyone leaves, who is supposed to do the job?” he said. “Nobody says we are a suicide squad or looking for a way to die somewhere. But ... we do our job. And we will continue to do so.” Britain yesterday unveiled long-awaited reforms to the country’s corporate reporting and audit regime via a new regulator after a swathe of recent high-profile bankruptcies - but the revamp is a watered-down version of an originally mooted shake-up.    


The audit sector has been criticised for failing to forecast the shocking bankruptcies of the BHS retail chain in 2016 (PwC), the construction group Carillion in 2018 (KPMG) and the tour operator Thomas Cook in 2019 (EY).    

London’s new plans are designed to break the stranglehold of the “big four” auditors - but lofty initial ambitions touted more than a year ago have been scaled back in the face of a backlash from private business.    

In a statement, the government unveiled a consultation paper which it said would overhaul the system through a new regulator, making big business moe accountable and ramping down the dominance of the big four firms to increase trust.    

To limit the hitherto “unhealthy dominance” of Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PWC - the country’s 350 largest listed companies will have to carry out at least some of their audits with another provider.    

The government pledged to create a new regulator to “reduce the risk of sudden big company collapses, safeguard jobs and reinforce the UK’s reputation as a world-leading destination for investment,” giving the regulator powers to ban failing auditors from reviewing large companies’ accounts.

But the plans are less ambitious than originally proposed. The reform will target unlisted companies with more than 750 employees and an annual turnover of more than 750m, the statement said -- down on the envisaged threshold of 500 employees and 500m, which would have affected more companies.    

Several British media outlets pointed to the influence of lobbies in this retreat.      

The audit reform will also force large companies to be more transparent about their results and will prohibit the distribution of dividends if they are on the verge of bankruptcy.    

But smaller companies will be spared the new requirements and may even see their reporting obligations lightened.The contraction gripping China’s manufacturing sector slowed in May, data showed Tuesday, as some factories gradually resumed work after the easing of strict Covid lockdowns.


The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) -- a key gauge of manufacturing activity -- edged up to 49.6, officials said, from April’s 47.4, which was the worst reading since early 2020.

However, the reading remained stuck below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction.

The figures come as Beijing’s zero-Covid policy aimed at stamping out infections with lockdowns and mass testing is challenged by a surge in the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

Dozens of cities, including economic powerhouses Shanghai and Shenzhen, have been either fully or partially sealed off in recent months, prompting warnings of the gouge to growth being made by zero-COVIC.    

 “The recent epidemic situation and changes in the international situation” hit economic activity, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement.

But production of synthetic fibers, rubber and plastic products rebounded in May, as well as auto production, according to the statement.

While factory production and demand have improved “the recovery momentum still needs to be strengthened”, Zhao added.     

China is the last major economy welded to a policy of mass testing and hard lockdowns to eliminate virus clusters, but the strict curbs have battered businesses.

Financial hub Shanghai has said it will lift most restrictions on June 1 after two months of lockdown, while Beijing has eased some curbs.

The government has offered tax relief and a bond drive to help industries, and President Xi Jinping has previously called for an “all-out” infrastructure push.

But analysts cautioned that growth will remain weak until China eases its rigid virus controls.

Moody’s on May 30 lowered its annual growth forecast for the world’s number two economy from 5.2 percent to 4.5 percent.Traditionally eurosceptic Denmark votes Wednesday in a referendum on whether to overturn its opt-out on the EU’s common defence policy after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


The vote comes on the heels of neighbouring Finland’s and Sweden’s historic applications for NATO membership, as the Ukraine war forces countries in Europe to rethink their security policies.

More than 65 percent of Denmark’s 4.3 million eligible voters are expected to vote in favour of dropping the exemption, an opinion poll published on Sunday suggested.

Analysts’ predictions have, however, been cautious, given the low voter turnout expected in a country that has often said "no" to more EU integration, most recently in 2015.

Polls open at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and close at 8:00 pm. Final results are due around 11:00 pm.

"We must always cast our ballots when there is a vote", Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged Danes in the final televised debate of the campaign on Sunday.

"I believe with all my heart that we have to vote ’yes’. At a time when we need to fight for security in Europe, we need to be more united with our neighbours", she said.

Denmark has been an EU member since 1973, but it put the brakes on transferring more power to Brussels in 1992 when 50.7 percent of Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty, the EU’s founding treaty.

It needed to be ratified by all member states to enter into force. In order to persuade Danes to approve the treaty, Copenhagen negotiated a series of exemptions and Danes finally approved it the following year.

Since then, Denmark has remained outside the European single currency, the euro -- which it rejected in a 2000 referendum -- as well as the bloc’s common policies on justice and home affairs, and defence.

The defence opt-out means that the Scandinavian country, a founding member of NATO, does not participate in EU foreign policy where defence is concerned and does not contribute troops to EU military missions.

Copenhagen has exercised its opt-out 235 times in 29 years, according to a tally by the Europa think tank.

Danish PM Frederiksen called the referendum just two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and after having reached an agreement with a majority of parties in Denmark’s parliament, the Folketing.

At the same time, she also announced plans to increase defence spending to two percent of gross domestic product, in line with NATO membership requirements, by 2033.


"It was a big surprise", said the director of the Europa think tank, Lykke Friis.

"For the past many, many years, nobody thought that the government would put the defence opt-out to a national referendum", she said.

"There’s no doubt that Ukraine was the major reason for calling the referendum."

Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties have urged voters to say "yes" to dropping the opt-out, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament.

Two far-right eurosceptic parties and a far-left party have meanwhile called for Danes to say "no".


They have argued that a joint European defence would come at the expense of NATO, which has been the cornerstone of Denmark’s defence since its creation in 1949.

In December 2015, Danes voted "no" to strengthening their cooperation with the European Union on police and security matters for fear of losing their sovereignty over immigration.Traditionally eurosceptic Denmark votes Wednesday in a referendum on whether to overturn its opt-out on the EU’s common defence policy after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Netflix site and apps were no longer available from Friday and a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that subscribers no longer had access.  

“This is the fulfilment of the withdrawal from the Russian market” announced in March, a Netflix spokesperson told AFP on Monday.    

The US-based platform announced in early March that it was withdrawing from Russia after Moscow sent thousands of troops into pro-Western Ukraine.    

The spokesperson said the company had waited until the end of the current billing cycle before cutting off customers.    

Netflix is the world’s leading streaming platform, with 221.8 million subscribers at the end of 2021, but was a minor player in Russia.    

The company said in an April letter to shareholders that it had lost 700,000 paid subscribers as a result of its withdrawal from Russia, blaming the pullout for its first global drop in subscribers in a decade.    

Netflix is among a host of foreign companies that have announced the suspension of operations or outright withdrawal from Russia since the launch of Moscow’s campaign in Ukraine on February 24.ITH the passage of drastic amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, by the two Houses of parliament last week, the failure of yet another project to hold effective and impartial accountability of public office holders has been formally pronounced.

The National Accountability Bureau was created under the NAO some 23 years ago soon after Gen Musharraf staged his coup against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government. Much like its predecessors, NAB was transformed into a tool of political management soon after its inception.

Although both NAO and the institution created under it — NAB — have lasted much longer than any of the preceding laws and institutions established for the stated objective of across-the-board accountability of public officials, NAB has attracted much more criticism than most of its predecessors.

Using populist slogans of rooting out corruption and holding powerful public officials accountable, almost all civil and military governments have used the laws and institutions of accountability against political opponents to achieve their goal of eliminating or subduing their political rivals.


Pakistan’s first constituent assembly had passed the much-dreaded Public and Representative Office (Disqualification) Act, 1949 and it was used for the trial and disqualification of public office holders — up to 15 years for ‘undesirable’ public office holders.

In 1959, the martial law government of Gen Ayub Khan promulgated the Public Offices (Disqualification) Order and the Elective Bodies (Disqualification) Order. For Ayub Khan, the latter did a ‘great’ job by helping him get rid of all political elements who did not agree to voluntarily retire from public life.

It remains to be seen whether NAB will still be used as a political tool.

Both Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto used their own peculiar accountability devices to destroy their political opponents. Even the presidents of the country acted in a partisan manner when they established special accountability cells within the presidency to institute cases — mostly fabricated — against the prime ministers sacked by them to block their re-election.

The working, and later failure, of all these accountability mechanisms and institutions over the years proved that it was political victimisation and not across-the-board accountability that was the objective.

NAB has the dubious distinction of having its performance criticised repeatedly by the superior judiciary both in the latter’s observations and judgements. In fact, a compilation of all such pronouncements would make for a damning public indictment of an institution that was created with the noble aim of eradicating corruption from the body politic of the country.

It was not merely the performance of NAB that was questioned by the courts, the very law, the NAO, was also criticised by the honourable judges; parliament was advised to make suitable amendments. Displeasure was also expressed when some prominent public officials were photographed behind bars and their arrest was publicised.

Most of these observations and judgements appeared while NAB was investigating the political rivals of the PTI government. During the PTI’s tenure, the opposition politicians continuously complained of victimisation while the PTI government aggressively pursued its one-point agenda of elimination of corruption which, even by former prime minister Imran Khan’s own admission, could not be successfully implemented.

NAB actions against some senior civil servants and businessmen also sent shock waves through the bureaucracy and businesses. To the PTI’s credit, it tried to amend the NAO to create a sense of security in bureaucratic circles and the business community but the amendments could not be sustained due to the crisis of confidence in the PTI government’s relations with the opposition at that time.

The stage was therefore set for a major overhaul of the NAO and NAB when the PTI government was replaced by a PML-N-led coalition government recently. Although the National Accountability (Second Amendment) Bill, 2022, recently passed by parliament is still awaiting the formal assent of the president, it is only a matter of time before it becomes law.

Editorial: Changed laws

The amendments passed by parliament have addressed almost all those issues which were either criticised by the courts or the victims of the NAO. The deputy chairman has been empowered to become the acting chairman while the office of the chairman is vacant. The appointment process for the chairman has been streamlined by providing for the initiation of the process two months before the expiry of the term of the NAB chief, and it is obligatory for the government to complete the process of appointment within 45 days. A parliamentary committee will handle the appointment of the chairman if the prime minister and the leader of the opposition fail to reach an agreement.

Tax matters have also been excluded from the scope of the NAO and the period of remand has been reduced from 90 to 14 days. The procedure for the appointment of judges of the accountability courts has also been refined. The terms of the NAB chairman and prosecutor general have been cut from four to three years. NAO has been made inapplicable to cabinet ministers and a number of other office holders who have made policy decisions in which no monetary gain is evident. The powers of arrest have also been rationalised.

The PTI has criticised the newly passed amendments to NAO and some of their observations may also carry weight but, sadly, they have themselves deprived their substantial parliamentary strength from coming into play by resigning en masse from the National Assembly.

The amended NAO heralds yet another era in our quest for effective accountability and only time will tell whether the new phase will be any different from the previous ones. The real test will, however, be in the way NAB is used. Will it continue to be used as an instrument of coercion and political victimisation, or will it be allowed to emerge as an independent professional institution to hold the real culprits to acco­unt and fight the menace of white-collar crimes?

The writer is the president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development And Transparency.Russian subscribers have lost access to streaming giant Netflix in the latest pullout of a Western company over the conflict in Ukraine.    


The Netflix site and apps were no longer available from Friday and a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that subscribers no longer had access.  

“This is the fulfilment of the withdrawal from the Russian market” announced in March, a Netflix spokesperson told AFP on Monday.    

The US-based platform announced in early March that it was withdrawing from Russia after Moscow sent thousands of troops into pro-Western Ukraine.    

The spokesperson said the company had waited until the end of the current billing cycle before cutting off customers.    

Netflix is the world’s leading streaming platform, with 221.8 million subscribers at the end of 2021, but was a minor player in Russia.    

The company said in an April letter to shareholders that it had lost 700,000 paid subscribers as a result of its withdrawal from Russia, blaming the pullout for its first global drop in subscribers in a decade.    

Netflix is among a host of foreign companies that have announced the suspension of operations or outright withdrawal from Russia since the launch of Moscow’s campaign in Ukraine on February 24.

Street fighting raged Tuesday for control of Ukraine’s flashpoint city of Severodonetsk, with the situation changing "every hour", an official said, as Kiev warned its troops were outnumbered by Russian forces.


Just days ago, Moscow seemed close to taking the strategic industrial hub in the east but Ukrainian forces have managed to hold out.

"Our heroes are holding their positions in Severodonetsk. Fierce street fights continue in the city," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address late Monday.

Concerns about a global food crisis also grew as Zelensky warned of tightening grain supplies -- Ukraine is a top producer of the commodity -- due to what Washington described as a Russian strategy of "blackmail".

Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine on February 24.

After being repelled from other parts of the country, including Kiev, Russia has concentrated its assault on the eastern Donbas region and had been making slow but steady progress.

Severodonetsk -- the largest city still in Ukrainian hands in the Lugansk region of the Donbas -- has been the focal point in recent weeks, and officials described a fast-changing situation on the ground.

"The situation is changing every hour, but at the same time there’s enough forces and resources to repel attacks," said mayor Oleksandr Striuk on Monday.

"We have hope, we have faith in our armed forces, no one’s going to abandon" Severodonetsk, he added.

Zelensky warned Ukrainian forces in the key city were outnumbered and the Russians "are stronger," speaking to journalists after visiting frontline positions in Lysychansk, across the river from Severodonetsk.

Days earlier, officials said the Russians controlled more than 70 percent of the city but then Moscow’s forces were pushed back, and see-saw battles have been raging since.

The US-based Institute for the Study of War said the Ukrainians’ successful counterattacks highlighted "the declining combat power of Russian forces in Ukraine".

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, combined with supply chain snarls and climate change, has triggered stark warnings of global food shortages.

Moscow has blockaded the key black sea port of Odessa, and Zelensky said Ukraine had up to 25 million tonnes of grain that could not be exported.


"In the autumn that could be 70 to 75 million tonnes," said the president, whose country was the world’s fourth biggest grain exporter before the war.

In Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added his voice to the criticism.

"Right now a Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea is preventing Ukraine’s crops from being shipped to their normal destinations," he said.

Blinken said it was a deliberate strategy by Putin to force the rest of the world "to give in to him," and eliminate sanctions on Russia.


"In other words, quite simply put, it’s blackmail," Blinken said

Speaking at a State Department conference on food security issues arising from the invasion of Ukraine, he also described as "credible" reports that Russia has stolen grain from Ukraine for resale.

Britain followed the United States by announcing Monday it would supply longer-range, mobile missile launchers to Ukraine’s forces, which could improve Kiev’s fight against Russian firepower.

The British defence ministry said it would be supplying track-mounted M270 multiple rocket artillery units, which can strike targets up to 80 kilometres (50 miles) away with precision-guided rockets, double the reach of standard battlefield artillery.

The announcement came after Putin had warned that Moscow would hit new targets in Ukraine if the West supplied Kiev with such weapons -- but did not specify which targets.

Russian forces pressed their offensive on several other fronts in the east of Ukraine, with Kiev saying it had repulsed seven attacks around Donetsk and Lugansk.

The Russian defence ministry said its aircraft had hit three arms depots and a fuel storage facility near the village of Kodema, in the Donetsk region.

On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hit out at European countries that prevented his plane passing through their airspace, forcing him to cancel a visit to ally Belgrade.

Serbian daily Vecernje Novosti reported that NATO-members Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had refused access to their airspace.

At a meeting of the UN Security Council, the United States and Europe urged Russia to stop alleged sexual violence by its army and proxies in Ukraine, allegations that Moscow denounced as "lies."

And in Washington, officials accused Russia of trying to "intimidate" American correspondents in Moscow, who were summoned by the Russian foreign ministry and threatened with reprisals because of US sanctions.
The TV quoted an unnamed military official as saying that Israeli warplanes fired several missiles while flying over Syria’s Israeli-occupied Golan Heights before midnight on Monday. It added that Syrian air defenses shot down most of the missiles.

There was no comment on the strike from Israel.

According to Syrian state media, Israeli missiles targeted central Syria on May 13, killing five people, including a civilian, and igniting fires in farmlands in the area.

Israel has staged hundreds of strikes on targets in Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations. It says it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, such as Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group that has fighters deployed in Syria and fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government forces, as well as arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.
Elon Musk is threatening to walk away from his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter, accusing the company of refusing to give him information about its spam bot and fake accounts.


Lawyers for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO made the threat in a letter to Twitter dated Monday that the company disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The lawyers wrote that Musk has repeatedly asked for the information since May 9, about a month after his offer to buy the company, so he could evaluate how many of the company’s 229 million accounts are fake.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has said that Twitter has consistently estimated that fewer than 5% of its accounts are spam. But Musk has disputed that, contending in a May tweet, without providing evidence, that 20% or more are bogus.

Shares of Twitter Inc. slid 1.5% Monday, likely incensing Twitter shareholders who filed a suit against Musk late last month for deflating the price of the stock. Shares of Twitter are down more than 20% in the last month.

Twitter said in a statement Monday that it has been cooperatively sharing information with Musk “in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement” and noted that the deal is in “the best interest of all shareholders.”

"We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,” it added.

Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share back in April. A number of Musk’s actions since, including a public spat with Twitter’s CEO about the fake accounts, on Twitter, has led some experts to question whether the billionaire wants to use his loud complaints to negotiate a lower deal price or even walk away entirely.

Musk’s lawyers wrote in the letter that Twitter has offered only to provide details about the company’s testing methods. But they contend that’s “tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk’s data requests,” and constitutes a “material breach” of the merger agreement that gives Musk the right to scrap the deal if he chooses.

“This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” the letter says.

Musk wants underlying data to do his own verification of what he says are Twitter’s lax methodologies.

The Twitter sale agreement allows Musk to get out of the deal if there is a “material adverse effect” caused by the company. It defines that as a change that negatively affects Twitter’s business or financial conditions. Twitter has said all along that it’s proceeding with the deal, although it hasn’t scheduled a shareholder vote on it.


Last month Musk said that he unilaterally placed the deal on hold, which experts said he can’t do. If he walks away, he could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee.

Musk’s latest maneuver shows how he is “looking for a way out of the deal or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price,” said Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College. But Quinn said it’s unlikely to hold up in court since he already waived his ability to ask for more due diligence.


“I doubt he would be allowed to walk away,” Quinn said. “At some point, the board of Twitter will tire of this and file a suit” asking a judge to force Musk to stick to the deal.

Twitter has disclosed its bot estimates to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for years, while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low.

“If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company’s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates,” the Musk letter says, adding that he agrees not to disclose or keep the data.

The bot problem is a longtime fixation for Musk, who has more than 96 million Twitter followers and whose name and likeness are often mimicked by fake accounts promoting cryptocurrency scams. Musk appears to think such bots are also a problem for most other Twitter users, as well as advertisers who take out ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect to reach.

Musk’s lawyers are arguing that he is entitled to data about the core of Twitter’s business model so he can prepare the transition to his ownership. Citing a June 1 letter from Twitter in which the company said it only has to give information related to closing the sale, Musk’s team says the company is obligated to provide data for any reasonable business purpose needed to complete the deal.

Musk’s bot count skepticism was also taken up Monday by the chief legal officer of Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said he’s launching an investigation because he has a “duty to protect Texans if Twitter is misrepresenting how many accounts are fake to drive up their revenue.”

The U.S. and South Korean militaries launched eight ballistic missiles into the sea Monday in a show of force matching a North Korean missile display a day earlier that extended a provocative streak in weapons demonstrations.


The allies’ live-fire exercise involved eight Army Tactical Missile System missiles, one American and seven South Korean, that were fired into South Korea’s eastern waters across 10 minutes following notifications for air and maritime safety, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Forces Korea.

The tit-for-tat missile launches were aimed at demonstrating the ability to respond swiftly and accurately to North Korean attacks, the South Korean military said.

The South’s military on Sunday detected North Korea firing eight short-range missiles over 35 minutes from at least four different locations, including from western and eastern coastal areas and two inland areas north of and near the capital, Pyongyang, in what appeared to be a single-day record for the country’s ballistic launches.

It was North Korea’s 18th round of missile tests in 2022 alone, a streak that included the country’s first launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles in nearly five years. South Korean and U.S. officials also say North Korea is preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017 as leader Kim Jong Un pushes a brinkmanship aimed at cementing the North’s status as a nuclear power and negotiating economic and security concessions from a position of strength.

U.S. and South Korean forces conducted a similar live-fire exercise following North Korea’s previous ballistic launches on May 25, which South Korea’s military said involved an ICBM flown on medium-range trajectory and two short-range weapons. Those tests came as Biden wrapped up his trip to South Korea and Japan, where he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to defend both allies.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol during a speech marking the country’s Memorial Day on Monday said his government would pursue “fundamental and practical security capabilities” to counter North Korea’s growing nuclear weapons and missile threat.

“North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs have grown to a point where they are not only a threat to the Korean Peninsula, but to Northeast Asia and world peace,” Yoon said at the National Cemetery in Seoul, saying his government would “sternly respond to any kind of North Korean provocation.”

Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, has vowed to strengthen the South’s defense in conjunction with its alliance with the United States. His goals include enhancing missile strike and interception capabilities and resuming large-scale military exercises with the United States, which were suspended or downsized in recent years to create space for diplomacy with Pyongyang or because of COVID-19.


Yoon’s dovish predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who had staked his five-year term on inter-Korean engagement, refrained from missile counter-drills after North Korea resumed ballistic missile tests in 2019 as its diplomacy with the U.S. fizzled.

North Korean state media have yet to comment on Sunday’s launches. They came after the U.S. aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan concluded a three-day naval drill with South Korea in the Philippine Sea on Saturday, apparently their first joint drill involving a carrier since November 2017, as the countries move to upgrade their defense exercises in the face of North Korean threats.


North Korea has long condemned the allies’ combined military exercises as invasion rehearsals and often countered with its own missile drills, including short-range launches in 2016 and 2017 that simulated nuclear attacks on South Korean ports and U.S. military facilities in Japan.

Hours after the North Korean launches, Japan and the United States conducted a joint ballistic missile exercise aimed at showing their “rapid response capability” and “strong determination” to counter threats, Japan’s Defense Ministry said.

The United States has vowed to push for additional international sanctions if North Korea conducts a nuclear test, but the prospects for meaningful new punitive measures are dim with the U.N. Security Council’s permanent members divided.

Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution that would have imposed additional sanctions on North Korea over its latest ballistic tests on May 25, insisting that Washington should instead focus on reviving negotiations with Pyongyang.

Those talks have stalled since 2019 over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions for the North’s disarmament steps.

Despite facing harsh challenges at home, including a decaying economy and a COVID-19 outbreak, Kim has shown no willingness to fully surrender an arsenal he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

His government has so far rejected the Biden administration’s offers for open-ended talks and is clearly intent on converting the dormant denuclearization negotiations into a mutual arms-reduction process, experts say.
